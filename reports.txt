Reservation is actually keeping something reserved for a particular person or a party. Reservation system is very important now a days as some parties reserve tables for their special occasions like anniversary, birthday etc as the parties want to avoid any kind of mess or to wait and pay a good amount for it. Most of the restaurants use reservation log but some restaurants follow the policy of first come first serve. Sometimes this system is useful for the manager but sometimes they suffer loss as well. Because sometimes instead of coming after reservation, parties change their plans and the manager suffers loss. So in order to avoid such cancellations some of the managers try to make reservations more than the available space but if no cancellations are made then the manager suffers and he has to reserve a table in the comparable hotel and pay for table and the tax of that hotel.

It helps in recording and tracking expected expenses and income of the restaurant business, especially for future references. So, use a restaurant receipt template to create a restaurant receipt for your customers. There are different kinds of templates to choose from, depending on your requirements and preferences.
